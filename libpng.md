## `local libpng = require'libpng'` ##

A ffi binding of the ubiquitous [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html).

## `libpng.load(t) -> image` ##

Read and decode a PNG image.

  * `t` is a table specifying:
    * where to read the data from (one of the following):
      * `path`: read data from a file given its filename
      * `string`: read data from a string
      * `cdata`, `size`: read data from a buffer of specified size
      * `stream`: read data from an opened `FILE *` stream
      * `read`: read data from a reader function of form:
        * `read(needed_size) -> cdata, size | string | nil`
          * `needed_size` is informative, the function can return however many bytes it wants, as long as it returns at least 1 byte.
    * loading options:
      * `accept`: if present, it is a table specifying conversion options. libpng implements many of the pixel conversions itself, while other conversions are supported through [bmpconv.convert\_best()](bmpconv.md). If no `accept` option is given, the image is returned in a normalize 8 bit per channel, top down, palette expanded, 'g', 'rgb', 'rgba' or 'ga' format.
        * `[pixel_format] = true` - specify one or more accepted pixel formats (they are all implicitly 8 bit per channel since that is the only supported bit depth):
          * 'rgb', 'bgr', 'rgba', 'bgra', 'argb', 'abgr', 'g', 'ga', 'ag'.
            * if no pixel format is specified, resulted bit depth will not necessarily be 8 since no conversion will take place.
        * `[orientation] = true` - specify one or more accepted orientations:
          * 'top\_down', 'bottom\_up' (default is 'top\_down')
        * `padded`: true/false (default is false) - specify that the row stride should be a multiple of 4
      * `header_only`: do not decompress the image; return only the image header fields.
      * `sparkle`: true/false (default is false) - alternative render mode for interlaced images.
    * callbacks:
      * `warning`: a function to be called as `warning(msg)` on non-fatal errors.
      * `render_scan`: a function to be called as `render_scan(image, is_last_scan, scan_number)` for each pass of an interlaced PNG. It can be used to implement progressive display of images.
        * also called once for non-interlaced images.
        * also called on error, as `render_scan(nil, true, scan_number, error)`, where `scan_number` is the scan number that was supposed to be rendering next and `error` the error message.

For more info on decoding process and options, read the [libpng documentation](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-1.2.5-manual.html) (have coffee/ibuprofen ready).

The returned image object is a table with the fields:
  * `pixel`, `orientation`, `stride`, `data`, `size`, `w`, `h`: image format and dimensions and pixel data.
  * `file.pixel`, `file.paletted`, `file.bit_depth`, `file.interlaced`, `file.w`, `file.h`: format of the original image before conversion.

## Help needed ##
  * encoding API
  * jit is turned off because we can't call error() from a ffi callback called from C; and yet we must not return control to C on errors. is there a way around it?
  * the read callback cannot yield since it is called from C code. this means coroutine-based socket schedulers are out, so much for progressive loading. is there a way around it?
