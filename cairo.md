## `local cairo = require'cairo'` ##

A lightweight ffi binding of the [cairo graphics library](http://cairographics.org/) with the following features:
  * cairo types have associated methods, so you can use `context:paint()` instead of `cairo.cairo_paint(context)`
  * pointers to objects for which cairo holds no references are bound to Lua's garbage collector to prevent leaks
  * ref-counted objects have a free() method that checks ref. count and a destroy() method that doesn't.
  * functions that work with `char*` are made to accept/return Lua strings.
  * output buffers are optional - if not passed on as arguments, temporary buffers are allocated instead; the values in the buffers are then returned as multiple return values, such as in `context:clip_extents([dx1][,dy1][,dx2[,dy2]) -> x1, y1, x2, y2`, where dx1 etc. are `double[1]` buffers.
  * the included binary is built with support for in-memory surfaces, recording surfaces, ps surfaces, pdf surfaces, svg surfaces, win32 surfaces, win32 fonts and freetype fonts.

### API ###
See the [cairo manual](http://cairographics.org/manual/) for the function list, remembering that method call style is available for them.

Additional wrappers are provided for completeness:
| `cr:quad_curve_to(x1, y1, x2, y2)` | add a quad bezier to the current path |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| `cr:rel_quad_curve_to(x1, y1, x2, y2)` | add a relative quad bezier to the current path |
| `cr:circle(cx, cy, r)`             | add a circle to the current path      |
| `cr:ellipse(cx, cy, rx, ry)`       | add an ellipse to the current path    |
| `cr:skew(ax, ay)`                  | skew current matrix                   |
| `cr:rotate_around(cx, cy, angle)`  | rotate current matrix around point    |
| `cr:safe_transform(mt)`            | transform current matrix if possible  |
| `mt:transform(with_mt) -> mt`      | transform matrix with other matrix    |
| `mt:invertible() -> true|false`    | is matrix invertible?                 |
| `mt:safe_transform(with_mt)`       | transform matrix if possible          |
| `mt:skew(ax, ay)`                  | skew matrix                           |
