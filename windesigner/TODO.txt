steps toward delphi
-------------------
component pallette:
	- control icons (make them or find some with a good license)
	- customizable toolbar (hide/show/move icons)

object inspector:
	- value editors:
		- primitive types: bool, number, string
		- objects of a specific class
		- windows objects: cursors, icons, images, colors, pens, brushes, fonts, imagelists
		- nested tables with string keys and values of any of the above types
		- menu and popup menu designers
		- toolbar designer
	- allow changing of read-only properties by recreating the control

selection panel:
	- cut/copy/paste control trees (incl. pasting into the selected control)

serialization:
	- identity-preserving serialization (two phase)

winapi features needed by the designer:
	- published properties for each class with: name, type description, read-only status.
	- design_mode property for top-level windows so that properties like `state` can be set in the
	object inspector independently of the state of the window at runtime.
	- flag to distinguish container controls: accepts_children.
	- the list of event handlers with function signature for integration with a code editor

integration with a code editor (eg. scite):
   - need API for: insert line, delete line, find line by regex, goto line
