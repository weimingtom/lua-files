A ffi binding to the [Harfbuzz](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/) text shaping library.

work in progress...

here's a [quick demo](https://code.google.com/p/lua-files/source/browse/harfbuzz_demo.lua) to try out in the meantime (for which you'll need some [fonts](https://code.google.com/p/lua-files/source/browse?repo=media#hg%2Ffonts)).

TODO: integrate more from this: https://github.com/lxnt/ex-sdl-freetype-harfbuzz/blob/master/ex-sdl-freetype-harfbuzz.c
